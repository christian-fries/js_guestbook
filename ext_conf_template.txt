	# cat=basic; type=text; label=Backwards compatibility format: js_guestbook can use separate fields for first name, middle name, and last name. Everytime a change is made to a name field js_guestbook writes the changes back to the internal old combined field. Here you can specify a format for this: use %1$s for the first name, %2$s for the last name. everything else is up to you (see php.net/sprintf)
nameCompatFormat = %1$s %2$s
